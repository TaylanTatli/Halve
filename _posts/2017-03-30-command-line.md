## <center>The daunted command line.</center><br>

This part of my computer has previously been somewhere I have always avoided going. Opening the Terminal on my computer has always felt like being a child, alone, in a dark forest. What will happen to me? What if I delete the entire hard drive on accident? No longer.

This week I have learned some of the following simple commands, and my comfort level on the command line has grown considerably since starting Dev Bootcamp.

`cd [directory desired to move into]` : The `cd` command takes an argument of whichever folder you would like to enter

`pwd` : This command will return the location of the present working directory you are in

`mkdir [directory name]` : The `mkdir` command creates a new folder, with the given name

`touch [filename]` : The `touch` command creates a new file in the current directory

`mv [filename] [new_filename]` : The `mv` command can rename a file, or move it to another location, if provided with the specified directory

`open [filename]` : The `open` command will open the specified file, with its default application

`rm rf [directory]` : This dangerous command will delete the specified directory. Be careful! Using `rm rf` could cause you to irreversibly delete a directory (or your entire hard drive)!

`find . -name [filename]` : The `find` command, coupled with the `.` (selecting the current directory) and `-name` will search the directory for the file you have passed in as an argument

That's it for command line for this week. Now I don't feel like the forest is so dark anymore when I open up Terminal!
