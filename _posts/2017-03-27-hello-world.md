## Today is my first day at 
<img src="/images/devbootcamp.png">

After attempting to learn to code on my own, I finally made the decision to join this programming bootcamp, which opened in 2012. I will be spending the first 9 weeks learning remotely, and then the following 9 weeks on-site in downtown Seattle.

Dev Bootcamp takes students who have no prior programming experience, and teaches them how to code using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript. It also emphasizes engineering empathy, and just becoming a better human being. The latter really resonated with me, and is a large reason why I picked this program over some of the other local options. Also, after meeting with Jerrod (the Seattle campus director), I was just blown away by how nice and caring he was. That is the type of community I want to be a part of.

I am so excited to finally begin this journey, and look forward to updating this blog with what I am learning, and my progress!<br>
